# ST
Scripts for the analysis of data from the spatial transcriptomics on triple negative breast cancers.

`STstuff` and `nonSTstuff` are two R packages that contain various functions for the ST analysis
(`STstuff`) and other plotting etc functions (`nonSTstuff`).

The ST TNBC folder contains scripts that were used to analyse the data for the ST TNBC paper (submitted).

The two packages can be installed directly from `R` -
```
library(devtools)
install_github("BCTL-Bordet/ST/STstuff")
install_github("BCTL-Bordet/ST/nonSTstuff")
```
