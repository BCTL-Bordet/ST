# ST
Scripts for the analysis of data from the spatial transcriptomics on triple negative breast cancers.

`STstuff` and `nonSTstuff` are two R packages that contain various functions for the ST analysis
(`STstuff`) and other plotting etc functions (`non ST stuff`).

The ST TNBC folder contains scripts that were used to analyse the data for the ST TNBC paper (submitted).
